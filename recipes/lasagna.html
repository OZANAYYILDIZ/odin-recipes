            With more than 15,000 5-star reviews, this fan-favorite lasagna 
            has to top the list. The consensus among reviewers: While this 
            recipe does take over two hours to make, this lasagna tastes 
            like it's from an Italian restaurant, 
            even for first-time cooks. Calling it the world's best may be 
            a little bold, but it certainly is Allrecipes' best lasagna.
